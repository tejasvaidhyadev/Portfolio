# **About Me**

Hi I am **Tejas Vaidhya** (you can call me Dev) :wave:,<br>
I am a Passionate Opensource developer currently in my third-year of undergraduation in the Department of Architecture and Regional Planning at IIT Kharagpur. I love Programming, Designing & Planning (after all i'm an architecture major), watching Anime, reading non-fiction, cooking, and finding new & interesting people.<br>
<br>
I have really enjoyed my stay at IIT Kharagpur. I am fond of film making and Eating. In my free time I like to eat(you can find me in one of eateries of KGP). An enthusiast of Technologies and fascinate by how it affects life of people.
