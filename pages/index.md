## **About Me**

Hello, I am Tejas Vaidhya (you can also call me Dev),<br>
I am an Undergrad Researcher, Passionate Opensource developer, and a tech enthusiast. I am currently in my third year of Undergraduate studies, pursuing my major in Bachelor of Architecture and Planning and Minor in Mathematics and Computing at IIT Kharagpur. 

My research interest lies in Computer vision and Natural language processing. Currently, I am researching on Probing techniques for Transformer based model.

I love Programming, Designing, and Planning (Afterall I am an architecture major). I also enjoy watching Anime, reading non-fiction, film making, cooking, and interacting with new people. I am a foodie. In my free time, I like to explore food (you can often find me in some of the eateries of KGP). I have always adored technology and am very much fascinated by how it affects the life of people.
