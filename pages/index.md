## **About Me**

Hello, I am Tejas Vaidhya (you can also call me Dev),<br>
I am an Undergrad Researcher, Passionate Opensource developer, and a tech enthusiast. I am currently in my third year of Undergraduate studies, pursuing my major in Bachelor of Architecture and Planning and Minor in Mathematics and Computing at IIT Kharagpur. 

My research interest lies in Computer vision and Natural language processing. Currently, I am researching on Probing techniques for Transformer based model.

I love Programming, Designing, and Planning (Afterall I am an architecture major). I also enjoy watching Anime, reading non-fiction, film making, cooking, and interacting with new people. I am a foodie. In my free time, I like to explore food (you can often find me in some of the eateries of KGP). I have always adored technology and am very much fascinated by how it affects the life of people.

            <i> <b><u>Oral Presentation</u></b> at the 6th Workshop on Noisy User-generated Text (W-NUT) at the 2020 Conference on Emperical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP)</i> <u><b>Shared Task Winners</b></u><a style="float:right; color:#3491fe;" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#covid"><u>More</u> </a>

      <div id="covid" class="collapse" style="font-size:15px;margin:50px">Twitter has acted as an important source of information during disasters and pandemic, especially during the times of COVID-19. In this paper, we describe our system entry for <i>WNUT 2020 Shared Task-3</i>. The task was aimed at automating the extraction of a variety of COVID-19 related events from Twitter, such as individuals who recently contracted the virus, someone with symptoms who were denied testing and believed remedies against the infection. The system consists of separate multi-task models for slot-filling subtasks and sentence-classification subtasks while leveraging the useful sentence-level information for the corresponding event. The system uses COVID-Twitter-Bert with attention-weighted pooling of candidate slot-chunk features to capture the useful information chunks. The system ranks <b>1st at the leader-board</b> with F1 of 0.6598, without using any ensembles or additional datasets. <br> <br>
